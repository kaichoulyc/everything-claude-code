# Documentation Lookup (Context7)

When the user asks about libraries, frameworks, or APIs, fetch current documentation via the Context7 MCP (tools `resolve-library-id` and `query-docs`) instead of relying on training data.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate when the user:

- Asks setup or configuration questions (e.g. "How do I configure Next.js middleware?")
- Requests code that depends on a library ("Write a Prisma query for...")
- Needs API or reference information ("What are the Supabase auth methods?")
- Mentions specific frameworks or libraries (React, Vue, Svelte, Express, Tailwind, Prisma, Supabase, etc.)

## How to Fetch Documentation

### Step 1: Resolve the Library ID

Call the **resolve-library-id** MCP tool with:

- **libraryName**: The library or product name taken from the user's question (e.g. `Next.js`, `Prisma`, `Supabase`).
- **query**: The user's full question. This improves relevance ranking of results.

You must obtain a Context7-compatible library ID (format `/org/project` or `/org/project/version`) before querying docs. Do not call query-docs without a valid library ID from this step.

### Step 2: Select the Best Match

From the resolution results, choose one result using:

- **Name match**: Prefer exact or closest match to what the user asked for.
- **Benchmark score**: Higher scores indicate better documentation quality (100 is highest).
- **Source reputation**: Prefer High or Medium reputation when available.
- **Version**: If the user specified a version (e.g. "React 19", "Next.js 15"), prefer a version-specific library ID if listed (e.g. `/org/project/v1.2.0`).

### Step 3: Fetch the Documentation

Call the **query-docs** MCP tool with:

- **libraryId**: The selected Context7 library ID from Step 2 (e.g. `/vercel/next.js`).
- **query**: The user's specific question or task. Be specific to get relevant snippets.

Limit: do not call query-docs (or resolve-library-id) more than 3 times per question. If the answer is unclear after 3 calls, use the best information you have.

### Step 4: Use the Documentation

- Answer the user's question using the fetched, current information.
- Include relevant code examples from the docs when helpful.
- Cite the library or version when it matters (e.g. "In Next.js 15...").

## Guidelines

- **Be specific**: Use the user's full question as the query where possible for better relevance.
- **Version awareness**: When users mention versions, use version-specific library IDs from the resolve step when available.
- **Prefer official sources**: When multiple matches exist, prefer official or primary packages over community forks.
- **No sensitive data**: Do not include API keys, passwords, or other secrets in any query sent to Context7.

## When to Use

Use this skill whenever the user's request depends on accurate, up-to-date behavior of a library, framework, or API. It applies across harnesses that have the Context7 MCP configured (e.g. Claude Code, Cursor, Codex with Context7).
